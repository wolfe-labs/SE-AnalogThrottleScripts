# AnalogThrottle Scripts for Space Engineers
üïπÔ∏è A list of AnalogThrottle-compatible scripts for Space Engineers

## Installing

Before everything else, you will need to have both the [Plugin](https://github.com/wolfe-labs/SE-AnalogThrottlePlugin) and the [Script](https://github.com/wolfe-labs/SE-AnalogThrottleScripts) repository directories next to each other, as the plugins use a shared project from the plugin.

Have it set so that you have, next to this repository's directory, one named `SE-AnalogThrottlePlugin` - this needs some fixing, it's here just to cleanup the previous repo.

## Usage

Run MDK Deploy to build the project that interests you, or follow project-specific instructions on their respective README files.

## List of Scripts

### [AnalogThrottle Debug Script](./AnalogThrottleDebugScript/)

Debug script intended for development, not updated.

### [WL Basic Analog Control](./WLBasicAnalogControl/)

Basic analog control sample script, mostly used for testing and developing the plugin.
